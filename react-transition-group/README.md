# Learn By Example:react-transition-group(with hooks)

## Introduction

`react-transition-group` is a powerfull library to make great transition effects.it is based on some set of steps that one can leverage to do any kind of transition effects or even animation.we will go through this library step by step and on each step we will learn different aspect of this library by building a fun project.
the library is consist of four components:

1. `Transition`
2. `CSSTransition`
3. `SwitchTransition`
4. `TransitionGroup`
   consider that the `Transition` componenet is the building block of other components.we take look at each one and talk about how we should use them.
   there are number of props that all of them share.the most important one is the `in` prop.the `in` prop is a boolean type that change the state.we'll talk about other props while writting an example.
   > important note:
   > all of the above component follow a simple rule.a transition is like a state machine consist of 6 phases:
   > enter ====> entering ====> entered ====> exit ===> exiting ====> extied
   > the `enter` and `entering` happens one after each other without any delay then there is a delay(timeout) and we reach the `entered` phase.now the user enteract with the page and the `in` prop changes then the component moves forward from `exti` to `exiting`,delay kicks in and finally componenet reaches the `exited` as the finall phase.
   > the transition happens if and only the transition effects declared between `enter` and `entering`, `exit` and `exiting`.for example we want to have a transition from `opacity:0` to `opacity:1`. the css would be:

```css
enter {
  opacity: 0;
}
entering {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity 200ms ease;
}
entered {
  opacity: 1;
}
exit {
  opacity: 1;
}
exiting {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 200ms ease;
}
exited {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

notice we have declared the transition property on the `entering` and `exiting` phase.
the `entered` and `exited` could have any css property that we want to set after the transition is done.the don't necessarly need to have the same css property as the their previous phase.

## CSSTransition

we're going to make this `card` component with a rotation transition

(showcase the example)
start with a simple card component:

```jsx
// Card.js
import React, { forwardRef } from 'react';
import { Button } from '../Button';
import styles from './Card.module.css';
export const Card = forwardRef(
  ({ children, className = '', onAnswer, back, front, onClose }, ref) => {
    return (
      <div className={`${styles.cardWrapper} ${className}`} ref={ref}>
        <div className={styles.front}>
          <Button className={styles.leftBtn} onClick={onAnswer}>
            Answer
          </Button>
          <div className={styles.frontContent}>{front}</div>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.back}>
          <div className={styles.btnWrapper}>
            <Button className={styles.leftBtn} onClick={onClose}>
              close
            </Button>
          </div>
          <div className={styles.backContent}>{back}</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
);
```

the `ref` is forwarded here because we need to provide a ref to our `CSSTransition` component.the `react-transition-group` uses the deprecated(in strict mode) `findDomNode` function and the react would warn you about it so it is much better to forward the ref and attach a ref prop to the component.we have used the `front` and `back` prop so we can provide anything such strings or components and the card will show on the specified side

and the css :

```css
/* Card.module.css */
.cardWrapper {
  background-color: lightsteelblue;
  height: 15rem;
  width: 15rem;
  border-radius: 5px;
  position: relative;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
.front {
  color: #000000;
  position: relative;
}
.leftBtn {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
}
.back {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
.front,
.back {
  height: 100%;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

the back of the card is rotated `180deg` and we set `backface-visibility: hidden` on both `back` and `front`.this property along side the ``transform-style:preseve-3d` is essential for the 3d effect.

the button component:

```jsx
//Button.js
import styles from './Button.module.css';
export function Button({ children, onClick, className }) {
  return (
    <button className={`${styles.btn} ${className}`} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

now the transition part:

```jsx
// App.js
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';
import { Card } from './Card';
import {
  enter,
  enterActive,
  enterDone,
  exit,
  exitActive,
  exitDone,
} from './Rotate.module.css';
export default function App() {
  const [isRotate, setIsRotate] = useState(false);
  const cardRef = useRef();
  const handleAnswer = () => {
    setIsRotate(!isRotate);
  };

  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <CSSTransition
        in={isRotate}
        timeout={500}
        classNames={{
          enter,
          enterActive,
          enterDone,
          exit,
          exitActive,
          exitDone,
        }}
        nodeRef={cardRef}>
        <Card
          onAnswer={handleAnswer}
          onClose={handleAnswer}
          back={'a frontend library'}
          front={'what is react?'}
          ref={cardRef}
        />
      </CSSTransition>
    </div>
  );
}
```

the `timeout` should match with the transition timing of the classes you have provided.we can specify a name(string) or an object on the classNames property.if a string is set, the `CSSTransition` would attach the corresponding classes to the `Card` compopent or we can use an object and specifieing each individual classes like what we did.
the `Rotate.module.css`

```css
/* Rotate.module.css */
.enter {
  transform: rotateY(0);
}
.enterActive {
  transform: perspective(150px) rotateY(-180deg);
  transition: transform 500ms ease-in-out;
}
.enterDone {
  transform: rotateY(-180deg);
}
.exit {
  transform: rotateY(-180deg);
}
.exitActive {
  transform: perspective(150px) rotateY(0);
  transition: transform 500ms ease-in-out;
}
.exitDone {
  transform: rotateY(0);
}
```

our `card` component start from `rotateY(0)` to `rotate(180)` on `enter` and vice versa on `exit` phase.(`enterAcitve` and `exitAcitve` are the same as `entered` and `exited` as we disscussed).the `perspective` gives us a nice 3d effect while rotating.

the final result:
{link to codesandbox}

let's make our `card` component more interesting.we want to give the user an abbility to see a hint.user click on a button and a hint would emerge on the front face, like a circle that scales.
{showcase the hint part}
user click on the hint button and a circle will scale and cover the front face reaviling a hint about the question.there are number of ways that we can achieve this effect.let's see the code and then talk about how and why.

```jsx
// Hint.js
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';
import { Button } from './Button';
import HintStyle from './Hint.module.css';

export function Hint({ inProp, onClose }) {
  const hintRef = useRef();
  return (
    <CSSTransition
      in={inProp}
      timeout={500}
      classNames={{
        enter: HintStyle.enter,
        enterActive: HintStyle.enterActive,
        enterDone: HintStyle.enterDone,
        exit: HintStyle.exit,
        exitActive: HintStyle.exitActive,
        exitDone: HintStyle.exitDone,
      }}
      nodeRef={hintRef}>
      <div ref={hintRef} className={HintStyle.Container}>
        <div className={HintStyle.content}>
          <Button className={HintStyle.btn} onClick={onClose}>
            close
          </Button>
          <div className={HintStyle.Hint}>
            something to do with web development
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </CSSTransition>
  );
}
```

the component is straight forward.be aware that we have used a `div` with a className called `container` and another one with a `content` className.there is two wrapper `div` around `Button` and the hint itself.

```css
.Container {
  position: absolute;
  right: -6rem;
  top: -6rem;
  width: 0rem;
  height: 0rem;
  border-radius: 50%;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.content {
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  width: 15rem;
  height: 15rem;
  right: +6rem;
  top: +6rem;
}
```

the container is positioned outside the card, `-6rem` on both top and right.the content on the other hand is exactly opposite.it is positioned back on the card hence the `+6rem` on both right and top property.now by setting the `overflow:hidden` on the `front` face the content is not visible but whenever the container(circle) emerge from the edge of the screen the content will appear too.
since the content has the same width and height as the card has we can position the content just as we want.
the transitioning:

```css
.enter {
  width: 0rem;
  height: 0rem;
}
.enterActive {
  width: 21rem;
  height: 21rem;
  transition: all 500ms ease-in-out;
}
.enterDone {
  width: 21rem;
  height: 21rem;
}
.exit {
  width: 21rem;
  height: 21rem;
}
.exitActive {
  width: 0rem;
  height: 0rem;
  transition: all 500ms ease-in-out;
}
.exitDone {
  width: 0rem;
  height: 0rem;
}
```

you can play with `width` and `height` of the emerging circle and the `right` and `top` property of the container to achieve the desire layout.the current ones shows a circle emerging while the circle won't fully cover the card.there is a curve on the botton left.I think it is visually more apealing.

## SwitchTransition

this component only accepts the `CSSTrasnition` or `Transition` component as a child.by changing the `key` prop on the the `SwitchTansition` changes the `in` prop those components.so no need to specify the `in` prop on the child component(e.g `CSSTrasnition` or `Transition` ).the phases are the same as we disscused earlier but with a little difference.it triggers the child component to change it's phase in such manner:

exit ==> exiting ===> exited ===> enter ===> entering ===> entered

it starts with the `exit` phase then work it's way toward the `entered` phase.that's what this component is build for **switching between components or states.it waits for the component to rich it's `exitied` phase then start the entering phase**.
in this example we are going to build a simple slideshow with this component.
